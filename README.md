# NUSTARS
This repository contains useful code for various NUSTARS stuff, mostly launch vehicle related.

## `readFlightData.py`
Reads in flight data from the chosen CSV file containing flight data from MissileWorks RRC3 altimeters.

## KE (Needs refractoring, see issue )
MATLAB code used to calculate kinetic energy at landing of a falling object. Useful for NSL since NASA requires that
nothing land with a greater KE than 75 ft-lbs.
