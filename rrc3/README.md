# RRC3py
Python library for reading CSV data from the MissileWorks RRC3
altimeter. Calling this a "library" is a stretch considering it is
just one tiny class, but we may think of additional functionality
to implement later on. Oh how nice it would be if we could talk to
the RRC3 directly without their MDACs desktop app thing.

## Usage
First you must save the .csv data file from the altimeter. Then,
see the `example.py` file on how to read the CSV and plot it.

If you want to use this in Google colab
you need to upload the rrc3py.py file and the CSV data file to
colab.
